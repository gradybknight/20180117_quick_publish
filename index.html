	<h1>Goats!</h1>
	<p>they eat everything. they'll mow your lawn and trim your hedges. how can you not love goats?</p>
	<p>There's really not much else to say. you can sit back, drink a beer, and they'll do your yardwork.  Best of all, you don't even have to recycle the beer can.  Just toss it in the yard and the goat will eat it!</p>
